This is my project that was done in my B. Tech final year. The idea behind this project is a database management system is
developed for the hospitals to maintain all the data efficiently that can be accessed by patients, doctors and administrators
via a common website. This system facilitates the patients to consult the doctors online and to provide online prescriptions via
a chat box which facilitates both the patient and doctor to communicate. And this website facilitates the patients to check 
their health condition based on the symptoms, patients can also consult doctors at their convenience by sitting at home.
